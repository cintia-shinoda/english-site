## Video Script - New Hampshire
There's nothing like that first big snow storm of the season. You can feel it in the air, right before it hits. And for us, that means it's time to head up to the mountains.
Pine trees all around, cold air rushing by, just gets your heart pumping.
The mountains have a peaceful way of bringing us all together, but they also have a way bringing out the competitive spirit.
Some of the greatest Olympic skiers got their start on these hills.
At the bottom of every run, there's a cozy lodge to warm up beside the fire and grab a hot chocolate.
There's something for everyone to do, every minute of the day.
The ski schools are great for the kids. Incredibly patient instructors make it all fun. With nearly forty Alpine and Nordic ski areas across the state, you're never more than a quick drive from an action-packed day.
Some of New England's most exciting parks and pipes are right here in New Hampshire.
Even when we don't feel like skiing, we always find plenty to do. You can try snowshoeing or snowmobiling... or attend a great winter event, or even spend a romantic afternoon ice-skating. The opportunities for a wintertime fun are nearly endless.
And  if you've never been on a sleigh ride, you just have to go. It's so romantinc, like something out of a fairy tale. The clomping of the horse's hooves, all cozy under a blanket.
You can also shop at a huge variety of stores, from one-of-a-kind boutiques, to bargain-filled outlet centers.
New Hampshire's winter days are like snowflakes: no two are the same.
