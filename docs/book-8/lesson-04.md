## Video Clip: THE GREAT OUTDOORS

**AT HOME**

- John: Well, Jean, I guess we should check the list to make sure we haven't forgotten anything. Let's see.
One *portable camp stove*, a cooler, four six-packs of soft drinks, one box with dishes and silverware.
Say, Mike, can you make sure *the flashlight is in the toolbox*?

- Mike: Sure, Dad. Oh, here it is! Thanks, Buster.

- John: Three boxes of food with lots of goodies and a case of beer. *That should just about do it*.

- Jean: Yeah, if we can get it all in the car, we should be prepared for just anything.

- Mike: Hey, Dad, don't you think it would be a good idea to bring the tent?

- John: The tent! Have I forgotten the tent?

- Jean: John, sometimes I think you'd forget your head *if it weren't attached to your shoulders*.

- John: Mike, go to the garage and get the tent, OK?

- Mike: Sure, Dad.

- Jean: Well, I guesswe can start loading this stuff in the car.

- Mike: Hey, Dad, *does the raft goes on top or in the back*?

- John: The air, Mike! Take the air out first, *and then put it anywhere it'll fit*.
<br><br>


(in the car)
- John: Everybody ready?

- All: Buster! (They notice they've almost left the dog behind.)

- Mike: Good dog!

- John: Well, it's a great feeling to know everything is going *according to plan*.
<br><br><br>



**ON THE ROAD**

- Christy: Hey! What's that noise, Dad?

- John: I'm afraid it's a flat tire, Christy. Hmm. Nothing serious. *It'll just take a minute to put on the spare*.

- Jean: Mm-hm. Yeah, but it's going to take more than a minute to get to it.

- Christy: That's right, Dad. The spare tire is *underneath all that stuff*.

- John: Can you hand me the jack, Mike? Boy, *these nuts are on tight*.

- Mike: Hmm, I think you're *turning the wrong way*, Dad.

- John: Hmm, could be.

- John: Well, we're finally on our way.

- Mike: Hey, Dad, could we stop at a gas station? *I have to go to the bathroom*.

- John: We'll be getting to the motel in about 15 minutes. *You can wait till then*, *Can't you*?
<br><br><br>



 **AT THE MOTEL**

 - Front Desk Clerk: Evening folks. What can we do for you?

 - John: We'd like a room, please.

 - Front Desk Clerk: Do you have a reservation?

 - John: No. Do we need one?

 - Front Desk Clerk: No, but it's always better to have one *even if you don't need it*.

 - Front Desk Clerk: Just for you and your wife?

 - John: No, we have a couple of kids and a dog ... a doggone load of stuff out in the car too.

 - Front Desk Clerk: Don't worry about your stuff. It'll be safe if you lock the car.
 Let's see now. How about a rooom with a double bed, a single bed, and *an extra rollaway bed for one of the kids*.

 - John: That sounds fine.

 - Front Desk Clerk: Do you want a room *facing the pool or the parking lot*?

 - John: The  parking lot, please. Preferably one where we can park the car right in front.

 - Jean: Come on, kids. Let's go get something to eat.

 - Mike: That's the best idea I've heard all day.
<br><br>


 (a few hours later)
 - Christy: My bed's nice and cozy.

 - Jean: Yeah, *our last night oof comfort* before we have to sleep on the ground like dogs. John, couldn't we just put the Nature Channel on TV and *pretend we're camping*?

 - John: Come on, Jean. You'll be *snug as a bug in a rug* in your new *sleeping bag*.

 - Jean: Argh, bugs! Did you have to remind me?

 - John: Well, let's all get *a good night's sleep*. We've got a long day ahead of us tomorrow. Good night, dear.

 - Jean: Good night.

 - John: Good night, kids.

 - Mike and Christy: Good night!

 - John: Good night, Buster!
 (Buster barks)

**AT THE PARK**

- Ranger: Good day, folks. Can I see your reservation?

- John: Sure, here it is.

- Ranger: Mr. John Holland, family of four, for one week. *You're in space 63*.

- Ranger: Here's a map of the park and a list of our rules and regulations. The twoo most important rules are: *fishing is allowed* only in designated streams an rivers, and, most important, *no feeding the bears*.

- Jean: Bears!

- Ranger: Sure, they come into the park looking for food, so be sure to keep everything in your tent or in your car.

- John: OK. OK. Thank you, Ranger.

- Ranger: *Don't mention it*. Have a nice stay.

- Mike: Are there really bears here, Dad?

- John: I doubt it; the rangers just tell people that *to make camping here sound more exciting*.

- Christy: Good publicity, huh?

- John: Yeah.
<br><br><br>



**AT THE CAMPSITE**

- John: Well, here we are. Come on, kids, *let's start unloading the car*.

- Mike: Oh, Dad, *let's go swimming first*!

- John: No. First we unload the car, and then we can go for a swim.

                                            ...

- Mike: Last one in is a rotten egg.

- Christy: *That's not fair*, Mike
You jumped in before you even said anything.

- Mike: *I bet I can hold my breath longer than you*, Christy.

- Christy: I bet yoou can't. One, two, three...

- Jean: Well, *I guess it's time to roast marshmallows*.

- Mike: And pop popcorn. Boy, the marshmallows are great! Hey, I think the popcorn is done.

- Jean: Yeah, *it looks like it is*. Mm! Smells great!

                                            ...

- Jean: Oh, *I can't stop yawning*. It must be time to go to bed.

- Christy: I'm tired too.

- John: I think *I'll stay up and get my rod and reel and bait ready* for morning.

- Mike: *And I'm going to help dad with the tackle*.

- Jean: Good night, everybody.

- Christy: *Night, night*

- John: Sleep tight.

- Mike: Good night, Mom. Good night... *Crispy*! Hey, Dad, are we really going to catch some fish tomorrow?

- John: We sure are. *The secret of being* a good fisherman and being a good outdoorsman in general is to *never lose your control*.
A good outdoorsman must be calm at all times.

- Mike: I'm going to go to the bathroom.

- John: OK. Taht was quick. You know, Mike, *to appreciate the outdoors* you need to learn to be... to be part of it. After all, people are a part of nature too.

- Mike: D... D... Da... Dad!!

- John: Run, Mike, run!

- Jean: *What's all the noise about*?

- John: It... It... It was a bear. It...It was right there.

- Ranger: Hey, that must have been Old Ben. He loves popcorn. *He can smell it a mile away.* Old Ben's as gentle as a lamb. *But the worst thing you* can do when you see a bear is to *panic the way you did*. Then they can be dangerous.
- Mike: Yeah, Dad. To be a good outdoorsman, *you got to stay calm at all times*!
