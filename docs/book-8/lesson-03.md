## Magazine Article: Rent my life!
There's a strange woman in our shower. She and her boyfriend arrived late last night, and she's slipped into our bathroom, which adjoins the office where my wife, Laura, and I are working. (...)

"Did you meet them?" Laura whispers.
"Are they nice?"

I don't know if they're nice - but does it matter? They are paying $135 to stay with us!

Meanwhile, I'm waiting for a nurse named Amy to return my electric sander. She paid me $4 to rent it for a day, and said she'd be back this morning. (...)

This is huge. The fact that complete strangers are willing to pay me to rent my belongings - the fact that I can make money from stuff I wasn't using anyway-is a breakthrough discovery or a par with penicilin or the second law of thermodynamics. (...)

Take our backyard deck and barbecue. I'm charging a group of people $18 to use it while I'm not even home. I'll be away meeting someone who's renting our dog for $3 an hour.
(...) Call me a rentrepreneur, one of the growing ranks of Americans who are finding creative ways to make a quick buck by hiring out their personal belongings. (...) There are now sites to connect people who want to rent out their cars, couches, personal services, or even dinosaur costumes. For renters, the sites offer goods and services for a relative bargain. More than that, they're a chance to bypass corporate America at a time when corporate America is in the doghouse. Why endure the long waits, high prices, and surly staff at your big-box tool rental counter when you can pick up Rob Baedeker's electric sander for a song- and go home with a smile?


There's a virtue in shifting from a throw-away society to a new economy of reuse. (...) And the cash does come  in handy. My wife and I, both writers and editors, make a decent income for now, but why not make a little extra scratch on the side for our daughter's college savings, or a remote-control pool shark? (I can always recoup the money by renting the shark out later.)

I kick off my experiment with our most prized possession: and old camping trailer we park on the sideyard of our (rented) three-bedroom bungalow. (...) I create an account at Airbnb.com, a San Francisco-based company that matches travelers with hosts. I list our trailer for $45 a night.

Almost immediately, I get a request from a user named Lee N. (...) However, by the time Lee N. and I talk, I've already received another offer from a guy named Etan B., who has three positive reviews and whose profile says he "likes tech startups and food!" I accept Etan's offer, and I chalk up $184 in the "plus" column. (Airbnb takes a 3 percent cut and mails me a check once he arrives at my house.)

I want to keep Lee N. on the hook, though, so I ask if he'd be interested in sleeping on an air mattress in our office ffor a discount rate. He offers $25 a night for four nights. (...) Then I remember that we don't have an air mattress-my wife gave it away when we bought the trailer. So I borrow one from my friend John. He doesn't ask why I need it, and I don't tell. (Is it ethical to rent out a mattress I borrowed from a friend? For $100 dollars, I am willing to table the question.)(...)
