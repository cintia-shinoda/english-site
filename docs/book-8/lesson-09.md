## Article: Thoughts on the art of cooking
For some people, cooking is just an exhausting chore that must be done because, after all, one has to eat. These folks may dream of being able to eat out all of the time or hire  a cook to work in their homes, but only a few privileged folks can afford such luxuries. For other people, however, cooking is a pleasurable activity in which they can use their creativity to tailor meals to their own personal tastes. Whether you enjoy it or not, cooking is undoubtedly both a science and an art. And these days, cooking has also become entertainment, but I'll get to  that a little later.

Cooking is a science because complex chemical reactions occur when we combine different ingredients and heat them. For science geeks, thhis can be fascinating. Understanding the scientific concepts involved can make people better cooks and even turn the family kitchen into an experimental laboratory where interesting new dishes are invented.

Fortunately, most of us don't have to study the science of cooking in order to make a meal. Everyone knows that there are an unlimited number of recipes available in books or on the Internet that describe exactly how to prepare just about any type of food you can think of. Of course, following a recipe is sometimes easier said than done, but most of us are able to successfully reproduce the recipes we find for basic dishes, especially if we choose one of the great number of them that are advertised as "simple" or "quick and easy"
