<h2 id="magazine-article-rent-my-life">Magazine Article: Rent my life!</h2>
<p>There's a strange woman in our shower. She and her boyfriend arrived late last night, and she's slipped into our bathroom, which adjoins the office where my wife, Laura, and I are working. (...)</p>
<p>"Did you meet them?" Laura whispers.
"Are they nice?"</p>
<p>I don't know if they're nice - but does it matter? They are paying $135 to stay with us!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I'm waiting for a nurse named Amy to return my electric sander. She paid me $4 to rent it for a day, and said she'd be back this morning. (...)</p>
<p>This is huge. The fact that complete strangers are willing to pay me to rent my belongings - the fact that I can make money from stuff I wasn't using anyway-is a breakthrough discovery or a par with penicilin or the second law of thermodynamics. (...)</p>
<p>Take our backyard deck and barbecue. I'm charging a group of people $18 to use it while I'm not even home. I'll be away meeting someone who's renting our dog for $3 an hour.
(...) Call me a rentrepreneur, one of the growing ranks of Americans who are finding creative ways to make a quick buck by hiring out their personal belongings. (...) There are now sites to connect people who want to rent out their cars, couches, personal services, or even dinosaur costumes. For renters, the sites offer goods and services for a relative bargain. More than that, they're a chance to bypass corporate America at a time when corporate America is in the doghouse. Why endure the long waits, high prices, and surly staff at your big-box tool rental counter when you can pick up Rob Baedeker's electric sander for a song- and go home with a smile?</p>
<p>There's a virtue in shifting from a throw-away society to a new economy of reuse. (...) And the cash does come  in handy. My wife and I, both writers and editors, make a decent income for now, but why not make a little extra scratch on the side for our daughter's college savings, or a remote-control pool shark? (I can always recoup the money by renting the shark out later.)</p>
<p>I kick off my experiment with our most prized possession: and old camping trailer we park on the sideyard of our (rented) three-bedroom bungalow. (...) I create an account at Airbnb.com, a San Francisco-based company that matches travelers with hosts. I list our trailer for $45 a night.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, I get a request from a user named Lee N. (...) However, by the time Lee N. and I talk, I've already received another offer from a guy named Etan B., who has three positive reviews and whose profile says he "likes tech startups and food!" I accept Etan's offer, and I chalk up $184 in the "plus" column. (Airbnb takes a 3 percent cut and mails me a check once he arrives at my house.)</p>
<p>I want to keep Lee N. on the hook, though, so I ask if he'd be interested in sleeping on an air mattress in our office ffor a discount rate. He offers $25 a night for four nights. (...) Then I remember that we don't have an air mattress-my wife gave it away when we bought the trailer. So I borrow one from my friend John. He doesn't ask why I need it, and I don't tell. (Is it ethical to rent out a mattress I borrowed from a friend? For $100 dollars, I am willing to table the question.)(...)</p>
<p>Once you've rented out extra space in your home, everything starts to look like a dormant cash cow. (...) I post my daughter's red wagon, my wife's Vitamix blender, and my landlord's weed whacker (the moral code I follow on these items- which aren't technically "mine"- is "what they don't know won't hurt them". I think it comes from Socrates).</p>
<p>I put a flier up in our neighborhoood with the headline, "Need a weed whacker?" and then a list of my tools and other items for rent. I also announce my available services via email, Twitter, Facebook, and a blog post.(...)</p>
<p>I mention to my wife that I've put her new Vitamix blender up for rent oon a new site that calls itself a "person-to-person rental marketplace," which noot only helps people make - or save - money, but also helps the environment. Regardless, my wife is noot cool with that. I apologize, but leave the ad online.(...)</p>
<p>Then I have an epiphany: I've been overlooking one of our biggest rentable assets, which is idling right under our noses: our border collie, Clementine. Surely there's a dog lover out there who can't afford the full-time commitment (or who's been forbidden to own one by some kind of court order).</p>
<p>I put an ad online:
Rent my dog! $3 (Berkeley) Sweet 7-year-old Border Collie available for leisure / companionship. Take her for a walk: a great way to strike up conversations with strangers and perhaps meet someone special. Throw the ball with her for an hour and you'll both be reinvigorated.</p>
<p>The next day I get an email from a woman named Jude Bell. (...) She is a kind-sounding 60-year-old financial analyst working at UC Berkeley. She says she "can't get enough of dogs" and that her landlord won't leet her have one.</p>
<p>It is at this moment, I realize I am a true genius: I've just discovered a way for people to pay me to walk my dog.</p>
<p>Jude and I arrange to meet on campus during her lunch hour, and Jude takes Clementine to a nearby soccer field and plays fetch while I hang around, to make sure Clemmy doesn't get dognapped. (...)</p>
<p>By the time I arrive home, there's a $3 credit in my PayPal account, along with a message from Jude: "I don't think I've ever had so much fun for $3! I thoroughly enjoyed every moment." (Mental note: I definitely undercharged her.) The woman in our shower - her name is Megan - turns out to be friendly and considerate. So is her boyfriend, Mason.(...)
He's 23 and an editor at a sustainable-business website; she's 28 and is an out-of-work elementary-school teacher. They booked our trailer for three days through Airbnb.com, adding another $131 to my haul.(...)</p>
<p>I'm planning to blow my extra income on an apology vacation with my wife, to make up for trying to rent her fancy blender. (I've actually still left the post online, but please don't tell ther. I think when she sees we can make money from it instead of just letting it idle, she'll come around.)</p>
<p>P.S. If you're interested in renting a great blender at an incredible price, shoot me an email. The dog's included, too.</p>
