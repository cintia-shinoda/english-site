<h2 id="article-thoughts-on-the-art-of-cooking">Article: Thoughts on the art of cooking</h2>
<p>For some people, cooking is just an exhausting chore that must be done because, after all, one has to eat. These folks may dream of being able to eat out all of the time or hire  a cook to work in their homes, but only a few privileged folks can afford such luxuries. For other people, however, cooking is a pleasurable activity in which they can use their creativity to tailor meals to their own personal tastes. Whether you enjoy it or not, cooking is undoubtedly both a science and an art. And these days, cooking has also become entertainment, but I'll get to  that a little later.</p>
<p>Cooking is a science because complex chemical reactions occur when we combine different ingredients and heat them. For science geeks, thhis can be fascinating. Understanding the scientific concepts involved can make people better cooks and even turn the family kitchen into an experimental laboratory where interesting new dishes are invented.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most of us don't have to study the science of cooking in order to make a meal. Everyone knows that there are an unlimited number of recipes available in books or on the Internet that describe exactly how to prepare just about any type of food you can think of. Of course, following a recipe is sometimes easier said than done, but most of us are able to successfully reproduce the recipes we find for basic dishes, especially if we choose one of the great number of them that are advertised as "simple" or "quick and easy".</p>
<p>In addition to being a science, cooking can certainly be called an art. Art is often considered to be a process or product of deliberately arranging elements in a way that appeals to the senses or emotions. Food undoubtedly involves and appeals to all of our senses, and most of us know what it is like to feel an emotional response to certain foods or meals. Like other forms of art, the judggment of whether food is good or not is subjective. Before you even take a bite, the appearance of food is an important part of the experience, as well as the aromas that appeal to one's sense of smell. As we put food in our mouths and chew, textures become an important factor in the experience. And, finally, our taste buds provide the final criteria that we use to evaluate the food we are eating.</p>
<p>As a kid, I didn't think about cooking that much. My mother did most of the cooking at our home, and I remember her food as being delicious, but I really took it for granted. Since I got married, I've shared the  cooking duties with my wife, and now that our two kids are old enough, they pitch in as well. As cooks, I wouldn't say that any of us is truly an artist except my wife, perhaps, because she can make anything. Her special talent is whipping up a great meal from whatever ingredients we have on hand, even when it seems thhat the cupboard is bare. We call her the jazz cook because of her ability to improvise.</p>
<p>The rest of us can certainly follow a recipe though, and we all have certain dishes we consider to be our specialties. My area of expertise is breakfast dishes, like pancakes, omelets, and hash browns. Our daughter loves to make desserts, and since everyone in the family has a sweet tooth, we all get excited when she gets started in the kitchen. And our son is an incredible sandwich maker who can turn a simple sandwich or a wrap into a satisfying meal.</p>
<p>As I've grown older, I've come to appreciate the art of cooking. I have especially come to recognize that, as in any artistic endeavor, some people have more talent for cooking than others because, no matter how hard I try, my food never tastes as good as the food my wife prepares. This increased appreciation for cooking has gotten me interested in what I like to call cooking as entertainment, and the whole family has developed a taste, so to speak, for watching cooking shows on the various streaming services we subscribe to.</p>
<p>When my wife and I were young, cooking shows were helpful but a bit boring. They generally featured a chef in a  studio kitchen showing you how to cook a relatively common dish-something not too exotic-that would be easy for viewers to make at home. But I'm never bored by today's modern cooking shows that take a variety of very entertaining approaches.</p>
