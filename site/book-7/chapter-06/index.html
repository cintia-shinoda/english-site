<h2 id="two-sides-of-the-same-story">Two sides of the same story</h2>
<p>Ben: I love to write, and I'm pretty good writer, even if I do say so myself. A couple of months ago, I won this really important essay competition. I was so proud of myself.</p>
<p>Brad: A couple of months ago, my brother Ben won some dumb essay competition. It really went to his head.</p>
<p>Ben: The prize was a trip to Europe, and I could take another person with me. I prefer not to travel with Brad, but all of my close friends were busy. So I asked him to go with me.</p>
<p>Brad: Of course yours truly was Ben's first choice to go with him on the trip.</p>
<p>Ben: Our first stop was Barcelona. After we had visited some of the sights there, ... Brad persuaded me to go to the beach with him.</p>
<p>Brad: I don't like sightseeing that much, so I talked Ben into going to the beach. I had a great time, but Ben got so sunburned he was hardly able to move. The following day we crossed the Mediterranean to Italy on a cruise liner. The liner was amazing. It reminded me of a huge amusement park.</p>
<p>Ben: On board the cruise liner, I discovered I hate traveling by ship. I was seasick the whole time. Our stay in Florence was supposed to be high point of the trip. I'm studying Renaissance art and architecture, and there's so much of both to see in Florence.</p>
<p>Brad: Ben loves visiting museums, art galleries, and old monuments, but I'm not into that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Ben: You won't believe it, but in Florence I spent most of the time in our hotel room recovering from my seasickness and sunburn.</p>
<p>Brad: With Ben confined to our hotel room while we were in Florence, I was able to do my own thing. I had a blast.</p>
<p>Ben: The trip was a total disaster.</p>
<p>Brad: The trip was a huge success.</p>
<p>Ben and Brad: Which one of us would you choose to travel with?</p>
<p>Voice-over: Which of the brothers would you travel with? It's your call.</p>
